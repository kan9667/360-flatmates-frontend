# Systems

This section documents the cross-cutting infrastructure that powers 360 FlatMates. Each page covers a subsystem that lives under `lib/core/` and is consumed by feature modules in `lib/features/`.

| System | Description | Key files |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| [Networking](networking.md) | Dio-based HTTP client, auth token management, error mapping, connectivity monitoring | `lib/core/network/` |
| [Realtime](realtime.md) | Server-Sent Events stream, Supabase realtime subscriptions, provider invalidation routing | `lib/core/network/sse_service.dart`, `lib/core/network/sse_providers.dart` |
| [Routing](routing.md) | GoRouter configuration, auth redirect chain, deep link handling, mode-dependent tab switching | `lib/app/router/app_router.dart` |
| [Theme & Design](theme-and-design.md) | Material 3 theming, color palettes, typography, spacing, shadows, motion tokens | `lib/core/theme/` |
| [Error Handling](error-handling.md) | Typed failure hierarchy, Dio-to-AppFailure mapping, localized error messages, async state views | `lib/core/errors/` |
| [Compatibility](compatibility.md) | Client-side matching algorithm with 6 weighted dimensions, animated ring widget | `lib/core/compatibility/` |
| [Analytics & Storage](analytics-and-storage.md) | Firebase Analytics + Crashlytics, shared preferences, secure key-value storage, image upload | `lib/core/analytics/`, `lib/core/storage/` |
| [Push & Deep Links](push-and-deep-links.md) | Firebase Cloud Messaging, local notifications, deep link routing, app config, API endpoints | `lib/core/notifications/`, `lib/core/deep_links/`, `lib/core/config/` |

## Architecture principles

- **`lib/core` is plumbing only.** No feature logic leaks here. Feature-specific behavior belongs in `lib/features/`.
- **Single Dio client.** All authenticated HTTP flows through `apiClientProvider` with the shared `AuthInterceptor`.
- **Three overridden providers at root.** `appConfigProvider`, `appPreferencesProvider`, and `secureStoreProvider` are injected via `ProviderScope` overrides in `bootstrap.dart`.
- **Typed errors everywhere.** Repositories throw `AppFailure` subclasses, never raw strings or `DioException` to the UI.
- **Reactive invalidation.** SSE events and Supabase realtime changes invalidate Riverpod providers; the UI rebuilds automatically.
